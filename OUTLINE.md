*Note: this is a living document.*

This document outlines the plans, ideas, and researches about the next version of /r/indonesia's subreddit.

## **Outline**

* **Built from scratch**  
  The previous version from *marssantoso* was built on top of /r/Naut, a very popular subreddit stylesheet. As cool as the design is, the code is a huge mess and not up to scratch compared to the standard on web development. Lots of hacks are in place to design elements not common to the original reddit design, which is fine but with the lack of documentations and the nature of CSS looking like hardcoded programming is very hard to understand.  

  The new subreddit will feature the latest development standards in practice in the web development world. We're relying on [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) â€” basically CSS with steroids, to give us a better code structure; and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) with [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io) to give us a local development workflow that updates real-time every time the code is saved without the need of regularly pushing the stylesheet to /r/indoclone to test it publicly.

* **Style**  
  Inspirations are going to be taken from elements that make sense on an Indonesian culture standpoint. This sounds cheesy, yeah, but the point is to make /r/indonesia looking different than the typical subreddit styles like /r/Naut provides, or iOS and Android designs. It might look similar, but it wouldn't be 100% same.  
  Things that can be easily influenced with, for example, can be icons.

* **Deadline**  
  **August 2015** by the latest, or before /r/indonesia reaches 10,000 subscribers
